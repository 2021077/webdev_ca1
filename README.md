WebDev Database Website Assignment for CCT

My database website project for CCT college - first commit.

Still working on database schema and normalising, but I know I will need multiple linked pages with tables, styled with CSS in a separate file, and zebra styling other requirements (in assignment question details below)
So I made  one table I am pretty sure I will need - department - which, for now, is index.html. Have setup folder structure for css and images and got zebra striping working with dummy data. add to this and change it when finish normalisation and know how many pages I  need. Dummy links at bottom of index.html dont work yet.
