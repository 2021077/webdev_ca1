WebDev Database Website Assignment for CCT

My database website project for CCT college - first commit.

Still working on database schema and normalising, but I know I will need multiple linked pages with tables, styled with CSS in a separate file, and zebra styling other requirements (in assignment question details below)
So I made  one table I am pretty sure I will need - department - which, for now, is index.html. Have setup folder structure for css and images and got zebra striping working with dummy data. add to this and change it when finish normalisation and know how many pages I  need. Dummy links at bottom of index.html dont work yet.

2nd/3rd commit:
Made the homepage index.html containing  a menu of links to the other tables which are still to be finished normalising. Now lins to the department table page and the first link (back to home) on the bottom of the department page also works.
